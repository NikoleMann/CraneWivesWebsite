# CraneWivesWebsite
Making a website for one of my favorite bands to practice Javascript, HTML, and CSS with extra emphasis on the HTML and CSS.

This is stage one of my plan to build my way up to PandaPlannerRedux, a remade version of my capstone as a solor project. Each stage will be a smaller project having me hone skills of one aspect of a larger project.
